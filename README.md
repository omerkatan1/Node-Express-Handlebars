# Node-Express-Handlebars

## About
This web application uses mysql and MVC to generate burgers that could be "devoured". Once a burger is "eaten" then it will move to a a different module that holds all the burgers that have been devoured.

## How it works
This application uses express handlebars to create html placeholders for a burgers that can be added and eaten. It also uses MySql to store and create unique ID's for each burger so that they could be tracked and moved depending on the users choice. I used postman for testing ajax calls.
